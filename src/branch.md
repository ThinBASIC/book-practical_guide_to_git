## Branch

Unit of the organization in a repository, basically a pointer to a commit.

Branches are indicated in brackets in this book: `[branch]`

### *Master* branch

The branch present in any new repository is called *master*.

> `[master]` should not contain work in progress code. It should be used for storing the finished version of the code for a given application/solution version.

### Additional branches
Any new modifications - features, fixes, refactoring, documentation adjustments or tests - should be developed in separate branches, before promoting them to `[master]`.

> Unlike `[master]`, it is perfectly fine if the branch contains work in progress code.
