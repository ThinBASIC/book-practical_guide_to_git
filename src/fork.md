## Fork

The fork is a clone of an already existing repository.

### When is this needed?

Usually, when you join existing projects, you don't have the right to modify them directly.

By creating a fork, a clone of the original, you may start working on your own version or create changes in the fork and propose them to the original repository via so-called *pull requests*.

You will not need to create a fork when working on your own project alone.
