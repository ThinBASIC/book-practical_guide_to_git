## Pull request

Request for a change, based on an existing branch.

### Meaning

While on your local repository, you can always merge one branch to another, when working on a project with somebody else, you should never do it directly, but via *pull request* instead.

Doing *pull request* will allow *you* to specify where you want to integrate your change, while it will allow *the reviewer* to check the change, possibly propose changes and then *the reviewer* can do the merge.

While this dance around the integration might seem redundant, it has many benefits:
- the code will be seen, your collaborator will be better aware of the change
- the code can be improved before integration, giving you valuable coding lesson
