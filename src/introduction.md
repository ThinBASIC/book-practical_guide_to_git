## What do I gain learning Git?

Using Git through your development will allow you the following:
- track changes from the start of the project till its current state
- compare changes, line-by-line, between two versions of the code
- work on multiple variants without the need for crazy copy-paste 
- feel more confident during bigger changes, because you can always safely go back
- collaborate on single code with others in a standardized, organized way
- have code accessible anywhere, because it can be stored in the cloud

Git is a version control system which became the de-facto standard, used by both individuals, developers of operating systems and big companies.

By learning Git, you learn a tool which you can re-use with different languages and in different situations.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is one of the providers of storage for the Git data. There are many alternatives, such as GitLab, SourceForge or Stash.

GitHub is chosen as a single example for this book, for the purpose of simplicity, while providing free accounts for your experiments.

## How to read this book?

This book is written in a goal-oriented fashion. The best way to get the most out of this book is to start applying what you read immediately, even if on a dummy project.
